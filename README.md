### Hi there! I'm Filippo. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer focused on build complex UI/UX applications using React and React Native. ðŸ’»âœ¨

I'm passionate about technology that improves lived experiences. As a professional developer I want to help create tools that make a real difference to real people.

I'm an advocate for inclusion, accessibility and diversity in all areas. Corporate efforts to remove internal opportunity barriers are super important, no question, but there's a whole big world outside of the workplace and there's a lot of work to be done there. Try to take it home.

Aspects of work that I especially enjoy:
- Solving technical problems
- Designing elegant solutions
- Continuous learning
- Working closely with passionate people
- Supporting & uplifting
- Tech for good
